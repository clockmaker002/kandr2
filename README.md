To see the answers it's probably best to look at the list of commits rather
than the files themselves, as for instance [this commit](https://github.com/danlucraft/kandr2/commit/9cead8ca3ffdd03816a20566d2236b9ed793cda7)
shows exactly what changed from the example code to solve the problem. (The
previous commit to this simply committed the example code unchanged.)

Some of the files have my own notes in the top comment after the `---`, and most
of them include the output from running the code in a comment at the bottom.
